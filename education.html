            <h2>Highschool</h2>
        <p class="hs">I graduated from highschool in 2018 from Palmetto Ridge Highschool. If you ask anyone from the area, they will tell you that its not really the <i>best</i> school someone can attend. Depsite all this, I still wouldn't have traded my education there for anywhere else. Some of the teachers may not have been the most qualified, but they cared. Thanks to the care put in by them, I managed to graduate with several industry certifications before I even became a legal adult.</p>
           
          <h2>Certifications</h2>    
            <ul class="cert">
              <li>Microsoft Office Certification (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Outlook)</li>
              <li>Autodesk Revit Architectural Planning</li>
              <li>Autodesk Inventor 3D Modeling Software</li>    
            </ul>

    
    <h2>Extracurricular</h2>

            <p class="ext">Besides the classes I have taken, most of my knowledge comes from things I've done outside of school hours. For example, I was on a trivia team for four years, and we even qualified for nationals in our last year. I also competed in FGCU's SunChase competition in my last two years of highschool.</p>
