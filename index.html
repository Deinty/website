        <h1>About Me</h1>
    </div>
        <p class="me">I am Nick Garcia, a student at Florida Gulf Coast Unviersity studying to become a Software Engineer. While I'm not currently planning on changing my major anytime soon, who knows what the future holds. While I was born in Havanna, Cuba, my family and I moved to the US when I was only two years old, and grew up in Naples, Florida for most of my life. At the age of 16 I became a US citizen alongside my mother.</p>
        
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p class="hobbies">While I share many hobbies with people my age such (video games, sleeping, the occational sports game), I also have a few hobbies that area a bit out there. For one, my friends and I are really into board games. We can spend hours playing a game like Betrayal or Dead of Winter. More recently, we have started to try some war gaming with the Warhammer system. Aside from those, however, there is the long standing classic of Magic: The Gathering. I do have hobbies besides gaming, believe it or not. In my free time, I enjoy doing some 3D modeling just for the sake of it. You can see some of it over on my Projects page.</p>
